DESCRIPTION:Words: everyone uses them. But how do computers use them and ho
 w is it different from how people use them and also how do we make computer
 s speak? Trick question: they use speakers. But also it is more complicated
 \, sometimes. Join David Ferris in making weird mouth sounds and go on a ma
 rvelous journey through the vocal tract\, zoom through a crash course on li
 nguistics for engineers\, and maybe learn the true meaning of friendship. O
 r how speech synthesis works. The latter is more likely.
